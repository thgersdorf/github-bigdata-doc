\section{Fundamental and Derived Measures}
\subsection{Terminology}
\begin{description}
\item [Repository] A repository is the basic 'project' unit in language of software development. A user or an organization can have many software repositories. Each repository typically has branches (very often with a 'main' branch) which represent different development streams within the project. A repository typically also releases ready pieces of software.
\item[Issue] An issue is a generalized form of everything which should be improved on a piece of software, like for instance bug reports or new feature requests.
\item [Commit] A commit is the action of submitting new code to the repository. Typically, commits are made \textbf{decentralized}, which means that the developer is typing "commit" on his own computer. One or several commits can be uploaded via a push.
\item [Push ] A push is a the action of uploading committed source code to the repository. It's one of the key features of Git's decentralized environment. During a push event, editing conflicts can emerge and then need to be resolved.
 \item[Gist] Gists are snippets of code to be shared with others, interdependent of a repository. Can be cloned, forked etc. like a repository, not super important here.
\item [Fork] Forks are clones/copies of a repository or Gist into a User's own account. The can be used to parallelize development of the project, the feedback to the original project can be done via \textit{PullRequests.}
\item [PullRequest] A user submits his additions/changes and asks the owners of the repository to include his changes into the original project ('\textit{pulling}')
\item [Payload] The contents of an action (like the source code itself, the comments itself, all acompanying information but not the meta-data such as timestamps.)
\end{description}

\item [Events\_Passive\_Involvment] Measures how much other users engage in projects of the user, events on the user's repository by other users
\end{description}

\begin{description}
 \item [Distinct\_Contributing\_Users] Number of different users contributing via IssuesEvent, CreateEvent, PushEvent, PullRequestEvent

\section{Constructed Leadership Measures}
\subsection{User: Envisioning and Goal Orientation}

\begin{align}
 LS_{\text{milestone}} = \frac{\text{\# issue directly assigned to a milestone or release}}{\text{\# total issues opened}} 
\end{align}

\textbf{Reasoning:}
Only the core developers know about the schedules for the project and are by social practices allowed to tag issues directly to milestones and releases.




\subsection{User: Leading People}
\subsubsection{Open Issue and Assign  User/Milestone}

\textbf{Measure:}
\begin{align}
 LS_{\text{assign}} = \frac{\text{\# issue directly assigned to other person}}{\text{\# total issues opened}} 
\end{align}


\textbf{Reasoning:}
The more people directly assign users to issues, the more they know about the people's capabilities and empower other users to solve this issue.



\textbf{Control for:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Total number of issues
\item Size of project
\end{itemize}



Assignee currently only via API from \texttt{ https://api.github.com/repos/thgersdorf/github-play/issues/1
}, see reference.


\subsubsection{User: Taking part in discussions}
\textbf{Measures:}
\begin{align}
 LS_{\text{comments}} = c_{0}\frac{\text{\# issue commented (not own)}}{\text{\# total issues of repo}} +c_{1}\frac{\text{\# PullRequests commented (not own)}}{\text{\# total PullRequests of repo}} 
\end{align}

\textbf{Reasoning:} When a user is is actively commenting on a large fraction of issues or pullrequests, he cares about resolving issues and incorporating improvements. Even though not central LS attribute, important activity measure.




\subsection{User: Empowering}
\textbf{Measure:}

\begin{align}
 LS_{\text{empowerment}} = \frac{\text{\# Comments mentioning somebody else}}{\text{\# All user's comments}}
\end{align}

\textbf{Reasoning:} Measuring how much a users refers to other users in comments, interacts with them (e.g. saying "thanks", "great",...)
TODO: Comments really all measuring empowering leadership?

\textbf{Control:} 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Number of comments
\item Number of different issues for comments
\item Number of different projects for comments
\end{itemize}





\subsection{User: Project Governance}
\subsubsection{Including people in project}

\textbf{Measure:}
\begin{align}
 LS_{\text{governance}} = \frac{\text{\# members added}}{\text{\# members in project}}
\end{align}

\textbf{Reasoning:}

\textbf{Control for:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Project size
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Closing issues | Gatekeepers}
\textbf{Measure:}
\begin{align}
 LS_{\text{governance}} = c_{0}\frac{\text{\# closed issues without commit}}{\text{\# total issues of repo}} + c_{1} \frac{\text{\# closed issues with commit}}{\text{\# total issues of repo}}
\end{align}

\textbf{Reasoning:}
Gatekeepers decide when an issues is not worth to follow up on, then they close it. Also, they can close an issue by using central 

\textbf{Control for:}



\subsection{Repository: Centralized vs. Distributed leadership}
TODO:
\begin{itemize}
 \item 
\end{itemize}







\section{Performance Measures}
All performance measures can only be performed over a time span, e.g. a month. Relative performance improvements or decreases can be measured by comparing two time spans:
\begin{align}
 \Delta P = P_{\text{Q1/2013}}-P_{\text{Q1/2012}}
\end{align}


\subsection{Contributors}
\textbf{Number of contributors}
\begin{align}
 C = \text{Push Users} + \text{PullRequest Initiators} + c_{\text{Issues}} \text{Issue creators}
\end{align}

\textbf{Contributors/Coreness}

\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{users-periphery.png}
}
\subsection{Release, Commits, Issue closures}
\textbf{Contributing actions}
\begin{align}
 C = \text{PushEvents} + \text{PullRequests} + c_{\text{Issues}} \text{Issues}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
 \text{Issue closing} = \frac{}{}
\end{align}


\textbf{Issue User Effectiveness:} 
\begin{align}
 IUE = \frac{\Delta \frac{\text{\# Issues Open }}{\text{\# Total Issues}}}{\Delta\text{\# User contributing}}
\end{align}



\subsection{Downloads, Forks, Views etc.}
\textbf{User activity:}
\begin{align}
 \text{UA} = c_{\text{Forks}}\text{Forks} + c_{\text{WatchEvents}} \text{WatchEvents} + c_{\text{IssueEvents}} \text{IssueEvents}
\end{align}
